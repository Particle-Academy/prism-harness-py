## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- Caller-supplied tool names now narrow a legacy session's mode list by default,
  through both `send()` and `send_structured()`. A name outside the ceiling is
  refused before a model call; an explicit empty list offers no tools.
- To retain legacy replacement behavior, explicitly set
  `allow_legacy_tool_list_widening=True`. This also preserves its previous
  empty-list fallback. The authorizer still applies, and named agents always
  enforce their mode ceiling.
- Remove an explicit `narrow_requested_tools=False`; it now raises a migration
  error naming the new opt-out. Explicit `True` remains valid, but combining it
  with the widening opt-out is a configuration error.

Legacy duplicate-registration and address defaults retain their existing behavior.
